polynvd3
========
to use all the nvd3 charts implemented in the subfolders of this project, just
import the ‘polynvd3.html’ file, and you’ll be able to use all charts.
When debugging or developing this project, you can import the nvd3 components
directly. This saves time because you’ll not have to recompile the project
every time you make a change.

See the [component page](http://polymerlabs.github.io/polynvd3) for more information.
